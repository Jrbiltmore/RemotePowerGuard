# Drone Power Management Project

The Drone Power Management Project is a software module designed to optimize power distribution and usage in a drone's systems. The project aims to enhance the drone's performance, power efficiency, and safety during various flight scenarios. It includes functionalities to dynamically allocate power, handle power surges, and react to potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events during freefall.

## Features

1. **Power Optimization with Genetic Algorithms**: The module uses Genetic Algorithms to optimize power distribution among multiple devices based on their power requirements, ensuring the efficient use of available power.

2. **Dynamic Power Allocation**: Power usage is optimized dynamically based on real-time demands from devices. The power allocation is adjusted to match the real-time power requirements while respecting device power limits.

3. **Handling Power Surges and Fail-Safe Power Allocation**: The module efficiently handles power surges by allocating the surplus power as fail-safe power to all devices, ensuring essential systems receive additional power protection.

4. **EMP Detection and Protection**: The module integrates an EMP detection sensor to monitor electromagnetic radiation levels and detect sudden power increases in nearby capacitors, indicative of potential EMP events. It automatically powers down critical systems in anticipation of an EMP, protecting them from damage. The systems are reactivated automatically once the EMP event has passed.

## Setup and Usage

1. Install the required dependencies and libraries specified in the project requirements.

2. Incorporate the "power_augmentation.py" module into your drone control software.

3. Ensure that the drone is equipped with the necessary hardware to support the EMP detection sensor.

4. Initialize the "power_augmentation.py" module to leverage its power management functionalities.

5. Monitor the drone's telemetry data, including voltage, current, and temperature, to optimize power distribution and usage dynamically.

6. Integrate the EMP detection sensor and relevant functions to handle power down and reactivation during freefall scenarios.

## Configuration

The project uses a configuration file named "config.ini" to specify default power settings, power ranges, and other parameters. Modify the configuration as needed to suit your drone's specific requirements.

## Logging

The module includes detailed logging to record power adjustments, power optimization results, and potential errors during power management operations. The log files are named "power_adjustment.log," "power_augmentation.log," and "telemetry.log."

## Safety Precautions

The EMP detection and power-down functionalities require careful consideration to ensure the drone's safety and stability during critical flight scenarios. It is essential to implement safety checks and perform thorough testing to verify the module's reliability.
